# CLAUDE.md

This project consists primarily of Markdown files, shell scripts, and
configuration files. There is no compiled application code. The SDLC
pipeline manages documentation, agent definitions, and process automation.

This file is the Claude Code entry point for this repo.

## Agent architecture

This repo uses a multi-agent SDLC pipeline. Do NOT try to handle the full
lifecycle in a single session. Delegate to specialist agents.

## What YOU (the main session) do

You are NOT any of the agents listed below. You are the user's interface.
Your only job is to:
1. Receive the user's request
2. Invoke the engineering-manager agent via the Agent tool
3. Relay results back to the user
4. Pass the user's approval/feedback back to the engineering-manager

Do NOT roleplay as the engineering-manager. Do NOT directly invoke
product-manager, principal-engineer, software-developer, or any other
agent. Always go through engineering-manager.

If you catch yourself coordinating the pipeline, reading state files,
or delegating to specialist agents directly — STOP. You are doing the
engineering-manager's job. Invoke it instead.

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

| Agent | Role | When |
|-------|------|------|
| `engineering-manager` | Orchestrator | Any feature/bug/refactor — start here |
| `product-manager` | Requirements & acceptance | Discovery and Acceptance stages |
| `principal-engineer` | Technical design | Design stage |
| `software-developer` | Implementation | Implementation stage (per task) |
| `build-specialist` | Build & test runner | After each implementation task |
| `quality-assurance` | Code review | Optional, before acceptance |

### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/kickoff` | Simple intake for single-domain changes |
| `/kickoff-complex` | Plan-gated intake for multi-domain/risky changes |
| `/commit-only` | Stage and commit with quality gates |
| `/commit-and-push` | Stage, commit, push with quality gates |
| `/run-pm` | Invoke product-manager (mobile workflow) |
| `/run-pe` | Invoke principal-engineer (mobile workflow) |
| `/run-sde` | Invoke software-developer (mobile workflow) |
| `/run-build` | Invoke build-specialist (mobile workflow) |
| `/run-qa` | Invoke quality-assurance (mobile workflow) |

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.state/feature-state.json` | Lifecycle state (EM reads/writes) |
| `.state/inbox/*.md` | Agent inbox files (EM writes, specialists read) |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture (generated during onboarding) |
| `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Coding standards (all agents read) |
| `docs/exec-plans/active/*.md` | Active execution plans |
| `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` | Technical debt tracking |

### Mobile workflow

Two Happy Coder sessions against the same working directory:
- **Session 1 (EM):** Persistent. Uses `/kickoff` and pipeline commands.
- **Session 2 (Specialists):** Ephemeral. Uses `/run-*` commands to invoke agents.
